## iOS 10 for iPhone 11+ (A13 Bionic only)
Welcome to i10on11!
This is a little project i have been working on for a while now. I got some spare iPhone 11, Pro/Pro Max just for this.
(I didn't use my main phone that is also an 11 Pro Max for this project. That would be a nightmare)
Note: iOS 10 will install as a secondary OS instead of overwriting the default iOS your phone has. But unexpected things can happen! So take a backup.

### REQUIREMENTS:
- iOS 10 iPSW for iPhone 7 (download included in Releases tab)
- very early iOS 11 iPSW, again for iPhone 7 (download included in Releases tab)
- iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max with iOS 14 and higher with atleast 64 GB. 512 GB is recommended.
- (X, XR and XS support coming soon!)
- Computer with at least: macOS 10.11 or higher, Windows 8 or higher and Ubuntu 22.04 or higher

### Guide
1. Grab the latest release of the i10on11 Patcher. Partial support for Windows is included, but i recommend making a VM on QEMU or VMware.
2. The installer will open an file manager window, or if you remember the path, you can always input it in the generic-looking textbox.
3. Once that's done, click "Start", a command box will open and start patching the iPSW's.
4. After the process is done, connect your iPhone to your computer and it will start sideloading the IPA used to boot iOS 10
- It will also "jailbreak" your device a little, by allowing advanced IPAs like that one.
5. Somehow get the IPSW file to your device by emailing it to yourself or putting it in a cloud storage provider
6. Open the now-sideloaded app named "Dualboot10" and import the IPSW file from your Files app.
7. Tap "Install"
8. It will begin installing iOS 10 to a secondary partition. Make sure you have minimum of 5GB free storage.
9. Once it notifies you it's done, you can click "Boot" to boot to iOS 10.
10. Complete setup, and you are done! To go back to your regular iOS version, Restart your device normally. (Powering it off using the power off slider works)

### Uninstall
1. Open Dualboot10 on your regular iOS
2. Click "Uninstall iOS 10"
3. After it's done and there is a pop up saying it is successful, Click "Restart"
4. A custom uninstallation screen will appear on your device. Once it's done, your device will restart again.
5. Done! No more iOS 10.
